Q: Attributes on NUnit

Ans:Below are the attributes of NUnit

 ** [TestFixture]: This attribute is marked for classes that contains tests
                   When you mention this attribute to a class in your project, 
				   the Test Runner application will scan it for test methods.
    [Test] : The Test attribute indicates that a method within a test fixture should be run by the Test Runner application. 
	         The method must be public, return void, and will not be run when the Test Fixture is run. 
	         
	[SetUp]: This attribute is used when you want to execute a piece of code before each test case.
	         It identifies a method to be executed each time before a TestMethod/Test is executed.
			 
	[TearDown]: This attribute is used to execute a pice of code after compleately executing ecah test case 
	            it will not execute if test failes or through any error message.
				
	[TestFixtureSetUp]: This attribute is used inside a TestFixture to provide a single set of functions 
	                    that are performed once prior to executing any of the tests in the fixture.
						A TestFixture can have only one TestFixtureSetUp method. 
						If more than one is defined the TestFixture will compile successfully but its tests will not run.
					    Ex: [TestFixtureSetUp] public void Init()
						
	[TestFixtureTearDown]: This attribute is used inside a TestFixture to provide a single set of functions that are performed once after all tests are completed.
	                       Ex: [TestFixtureTearDown] public void Cleanup()
						  
	[ExpectedException(ExceptionType)]: The ExpectedException rule allows you to verify that your code throws a specific exception.
	
	[Ignore]: Marks a test method or a test class which (temporarily) should not be executed
