What is API Testing?
 
  * API testing is a software testing type that validates application programming interface.
  * It mainly concentrates on the business logic layer of the software architecture.
  * In API Testing, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system's response.

Key difference between UI level and API testing

 UI Testing													API Tetsing

 * User Interface testing is like user interacts         * API testing is like communication between two seperate s/w systems
   the applications, testing application elements        * A software system implementing an API contains functions or 
   like fonts, images, layouts etc.                        sub-routines that can be executed by another software system
 
 * UI testing basically focuses on look and feel 
   of an application.
